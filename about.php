                <p>At Sign Service Label Products we have been supplying to the trade for 30 years. We started as a company dedicated to one customers work and have expanded over the years to include an incredible amount of satisfied, repeating, brokers, other label printers, offset houses, sign companies, and even other screen shops.</p>
                <p>We are a 100% Canadian owned and operated company which is also family owned and operated. With that in mind it is those things that dedicate us to making your experience with Sign Service Label Products a very pleasant and profitable one for many years to come.</p>
                <p>All products that Sign Service Label Products produces are hand inspected to ensure quality and to show you that we take your job very seriously.</p>
                <p>As a trade supplier we have to be sure that you have the confidence in our ability to produce the quality product that you would expect in your shop.</p>
                <p>We are proud to say that many of our customers have us drop-ship with their labels and packing slips directly to their customers and have done so with confidence for many years.</p>
                <p>We feel that you as the customer deserve more for your dollar and this is why we have chosen to sell you the best in quality and workmanship.</p>
                <p>Screen printed labels and decals are produced with high standards in mind. The raw stocks are of a more permanent type than available in most other forms of printing. Along that same path are the inks with almost zero percent fading<a class="superscript" href="#more-info">[1]</a> this makes these labels and decals ideal for outdoor use.</p>
                <p>The process of screen printing is done as sheet fed, meaning that each colour has to be fed through the press, dried, then put back through the press for the next colour. This method gives the operator much more control of quality.</p>
                <p>We feel that in order for your customers to sell their product, their labeling must meet exceptional standards. By choosing screen printed labels and decals you are already ahead of your competition.</p>
