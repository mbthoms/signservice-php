It is a product that is widely used in the electronics and telecommunications fields. But has many other uses. Lexan® is ideal for hi profile product markings as well as name plates and even screw covers. It comes in various thickness and textures, it is a clear material that is usually sub surface printed with a solid colour printed background and a .002" adhesive laminated to the backside, trapping the ink between the Lexan® and the adhesive giving it the ultimate abrasion resistance. .010" Matte Velvet Lexan® has a pebble like finish. For other styles and thickness please call or fax for a custom quotation. <br />
